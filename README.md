# 🛡️ AWS Cloud Security Lab 6.1 – Monitoring and Alerting

## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement monitoring and alerting for security-relevant activities in an AWS environment. The lab combines services like CloudTrail, CloudWatch, SNS, and EventBridge to detect, record, and respond to events such as unauthorized access attempts and changes to EC2 security groups.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Analyze CloudTrail event history
- ✅ Create a CloudTrail trail with CloudWatch logging
- ✅ Create an SNS topic with email subscription
- ✅ Configure an EventBridge rule to monitor EC2 security group changes
- ✅ Create CloudWatch metric filters and alarms for failed login attempts
- ✅ Query CloudTrail logs using CloudWatch Logs Insights

---

## 🧪 Tools & Services Used

- **AWS CloudTrail** – for tracking API activity
- **Amazon CloudWatch** – for metrics, logs, alarms, and insights
- **Amazon EventBridge** – to trigger actions based on events
- **Amazon SNS** – to send notifications
- **IAM & EC2** – for access control and test environment setup
